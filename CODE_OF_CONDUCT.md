# Code of Conduct

Zoi is an open project that welcomes everybody no matter their ethnicity, sex, sexual identity or orientation, age, socio-economic status, nationality, or religion. Regardless of what background you come from, feel encouraged to participate in the project and express your views as long you are respectful to others.

We value all members of our community and so in order to ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone and mutual respect among members of this community, we impose the following simple rules:

- No bullying, no insults. Any form of harassment will not be tolerated.
- No racism, no sexism, no homophobia, no hurtful extremist views of any kind.
- Be mindful of what you say, be diligent in how you say it.
- Show respect and, as always, be excellent to each other.

Violations of these rules or any other form of abuse can be reported confidentially to [contact@zillowe.qzz.io](mailto:contact@zillowe.qzz.io). Members who do not adhere to our code of conduct will be banned either permanently or until they change their ways so as to be compatible with a friendly, open, and inclusive community.
