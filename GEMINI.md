# Project Guidelines

This project uses Fumadocs for its documentation. The main documentation file is located at `docs/index.md` and the examples file is located at `docs/examples.md` .

**When adding new features or modifying existing ones, you MUST update the documentation.**

Before completing a task, ensure that:

1.  Any new commands, flags, or functionality are documented in `docs/index.md`.
2.  Usage examples are updated to reflect the changes.
3.  The FAQ section is updated if the changes are likely to raise new questions.
4.  Add title and description in the `---`.

- Update docs for any new commands/flags/functionality.
