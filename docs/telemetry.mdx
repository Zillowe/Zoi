description: How Zoi uses opt-in telemetry to improve the application.
---

At Zillowe, we are committed to protecting your privacy while also working to improve our application. To achieve this, we use an opt-in telemetry system that collects a minimal amount of anonymous data. This data helps us understand which packages are popular and which platforms are most commonly used, allowing us to prioritize our development efforts.

This page aims to be radically transparent about what we collect, why we collect it, and how you can control it.

## What We Collect

When you choose to enable telemetry, Zoi sends a secure, anonymous event to an EU PostHog cloud-hosted ([https://eu.i.posthog.com](https://posthog.com)) instance when you perform certain actions. The data we collect is strictly limited to the following fields:

- **Event Type:** The action you performed. This can be one of the following:
  - `install`: A package was successfully installed.
  - `uninstall`: A package was uninstalled.
  - `exec`: A package was executed without being installed via `zoi exec`.
- **A unique, anonymous client ID:** This is a randomly generated UUID that is not tied to any of your personal information. It allows us to distinguish between usage patterns from many users versus a single power user, which helps in prioritizing features.
- **Package Details:**
  - The `name` of the package.
  - The `version` of the package.
  - The package's `repo` (the sub-repository path, e.g. `core`, `community/editors`).
  - The `description` of the package.
  - The `maintainer` and `author` of the package (name, email, and website, if provided).
- **Registry Details:**
  - The `registry` handle (e.g. `zoidberg`, `my-custom-registry`).
  - The `registry_url` (the git URL of the registry).
- **The type of package:** This will be one of `Package`, `Collection`, `App`, or `Extension`.
- **Your operating system and CPU architecture** (e.g. `linux-amd64`, `windows-amd64`).
- **The version of the Zoi application you are using.**

**We do not and will never collect any personal or identifying information.** We do not track your IP address, hostname, or any other data that is not explicitly listed above. The code that collects and sends this data is fully open-source and can be reviewed in `src/pkg/telemetry.rs`.

## Why We Collect It

The data we collect helps us answer important questions that guide the development of Zoi:

- Which packages are the most popular? This helps us focus our maintenance efforts on the tools that matter most to the community.
- Which operating systems and architectures are most widely used? This informs our decisions about which platforms to prioritize for testing and binary releases.
- Which custom registries are being used? This helps us understand how the community is extending Zoi.
- Are there installation errors we need to address? (Note: We only track successful events, not failures.)

By understanding how Zoi is used, we can make it a better tool for everyone.

## How to Manage Telemetry

Telemetry in Zoi is **disabled by default**. You must explicitly opt-in to share anonymous data with us. You can manage your telemetry settings at any time using the `zoi telemetry` command.

### Check Your Status

To see whether telemetry is currently enabled or disabled, run:

```sh
zoi telemetry status
```

### Enable Telemetry

If you would like to help us improve Zoi, you can enable telemetry by running:

```sh
zoi telemetry enable
```

### Disable Telemetry

You can disable telemetry at any time. Zoi will immediately stop sending anonymous data.

```sh
zoi telemetry disable
```

We are grateful to everyone who chooses to opt-in. Your anonymous contributions are invaluable in helping us build a better universal package manager.
