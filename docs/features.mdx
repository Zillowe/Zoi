description: A comprehensive list of Zoi's features and command examples.
---

Zoi is packed with features designed to make package management and environment setup seamless and powerful across all your systems.

## Core Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Works natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows, supporting `amd64` and `arm64` architectures. Write one package definition and let Zoi handle the platform differences.

- **Dynamic Package Definitions:** Packages are defined using `.pkg.lua` scripts, offering unparalleled flexibility. Use Lua to dynamically determine download URLs, set up build steps, and handle platform-specific logic.

- **Universal Package Support:** Install software from any source:
  - Pre-compiled binaries
  - Compressed archives (`.tar.gz`, `.zip`, `.tar.xz`, etc.)
  - Build from source code

- **Extensive Dependency Management:** Zoi integrates with over 40 external package managers. You can define dependencies from `apt`, `brew`, `cargo`, `npm`, `pip`, `go`, `zig`, and many more, and Zoi will install them using the native manager, [learn more](/docs/zds/zoi/dependencies).

- **Rich Dependencies:** Go beyond simple lists. Define `runtime` and `build` dependencies with:
  - `required`: Dependencies that are always installed.
  - `optional`: Dependencies that the user is prompted to install.
  - `options`: Groups of dependencies where the user can select one or more.

- **Project-Level Environments:** Use a `zoi.yaml` file in your project root to define custom commands and development environments. Manage project-specific tasks, tools, packages, and environment variables with `zoi run` and `zoi env`, [learn more](/docs/zds/zoi/project-config).

- **Repository-Based System:** Zoi uses Git-based repositories to store package definitions. Use the official Zoidberg registry, add community repositories, or create your own private or public repositories with `zoi repo add`.

- **Secure and Verifiable:** Ensure the integrity and authenticity of your packages:
  - **Checksums:** Verify downloads against `SHA512`, `SHA256`, or `MD5` hashes.
  - **GPG Signatures:** Verify package archives against maintainer PGP keys. Manage keys easily with the `zoi pgp` command set.
  - **File Conflict Detection:** Prevents packages from accidentally overwriting existing files by prompting for confirmation.

- **Configuration File Handling:** Automatically handles updates to configuration files, creating `.zoinew` files for new versions and `.zoisave` files for user-modified configurations upon removal.

## Advanced Capabilities

- **Virtual Packages (`provides`):** Declare that a package provides a certain feature or virtual package, allowing other packages to depend on it.

- **Package Replacement (`replaces`):** Explicitly declare that a package replaces another, prompting for the removal of the old package upon installation.

- **Versatile Package Types:** Zoi supports more than just standard applications:
  - `Package`: A standard software package.
  - `Collection`: A metapackage that groups other packages together.
  - `App`: A template for bootstrapping new projects (`zoi create`).
  - `Extension`: A package that modifies Zoi's own configuration.

- **Package Testing:** An integrated testing framework (`zoi package test`) allows authors to define and run tests for their packages directly from the `.pkg.lua` file, ensuring package quality and correctness before publishing.

- **Split Packages:** Define a package that can be split into multiple, independently installable sub-packages. This is perfect for large projects like the Linux kernel, where you can separate the kernel, headers, and docs. Zoi manages these components granularly; uninstalling or rolling back one sub-package will not interfere with other installed components from the same base project.

- **Local Package Development:** A dedicated `zoi package` command set streamlines the creation and testing of packages locally:
  - `zoi package build`: Build a distributable package archive (`.pkg.tar.zst`).
  - `zoi package install`: Install a package from a local archive for testing.

- **Powerful CLI Tools:** Zoi offers a rich set of commands for package management and inspection:
  - `zoi about`: Show application information, credits, and build details.
  - `zoi autoremove`: Remove packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed.
  - `zoi check`: Verify that essential third-party tools (like `git`) are installed.
  - `zoi clean`: Clear the cache of downloaded package binaries.
  - `zoi exec`: Download and run a package's binary in a temporary cache without a full installation.
  - `zoi files`: List all files owned by an installed package.
  - `zoi info`: Display detected system information, including OS, architecture, and available package managers.
  - `zoi list`: List all installed packages, or all available packages from active repositories.
  - `zoi man`: Read package manuals directly in the terminal.
  - `zoi owner`: Find which package owns a specific file on the system.
  - `zoi pin`: Lock a package to a specific version to prevent updates.
  - `zoi rollback`: Revert a package to its previously installed version or the entire last transaction.
  - `zoi unpin`: Unpin a package, allowing it to be updated again.
  - `zoi version`: Print concise version and build information.
  - `zoi why`: Understand why a specific package is installed (e.g. as a dependency).
  - `zoi doctor`: Checks for common issues with your Zoi installation and provides actionable suggestions. It performs the following checks:
    - **Broken Symlinks:** Scans for broken symbolic links in Zoi's binary directories.
    - **PATH Configuration:** Verifies that the Zoi binary directory is included in your system's `PATH`.
    - **Outdated Repositories:** Checks if your local package database has been synced recently.

- **Shell Integration:**
  - `zoi shell`: Automatically configures your shell's PATH for Zoi and installs shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish and Powershell.

- **Library Support:** Use `zoi` as a Rust library in your own applications to programmatically manage packages. The `zoi-rs` crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/zoi-rs), [learn more](/docs/zds/zoi/lib).
