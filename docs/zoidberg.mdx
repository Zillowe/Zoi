## Repository Tiers

Zoidberg organizes packages into tiers. These tiers help to indicate the stability and maintenance status of a package.

| Repository  | Purpose                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`      | Essential packages and libraries; very common and well-maintained.                |
| `main`      | Important packages that don't fit in `core` but are essential for most users.     |
| `extra`     | New or niche packages; less common and may be less actively maintained.           |
| `community` | User-submitted packages. New entries start here and may graduate to higher tiers. |
| `test`      | Testing ground for new Zoi features and packages prior to release.                |
| `archive`   | Archived packages that are no longer maintained.                                  |
| `zillowe`   | Zillowe's own official packages.                                                  |

Note: Packages from `community`, `test`, and `archive` may carry higher risk. Zoi prints warnings where appropriate.
