# Zoi Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Zoi, the Universal Package Manager & Environment Setup Tool. This guide will provide you with everything you need to know to get started, from installation to advanced usage.

## Introduction

Zoi is a universal package manager and environment setup tool, designed to simplify package management and environment configuration across multiple operating systems. It's part of the Zillowe Development Suite (ZDS) and aims to streamline your development workflow by managing tools and project environments with ease.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Universal:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Repository-based:** Manage packages from different sources.
- **Environment Setup:** Configure project environments with ease.
- **Extensible:** Add your own repositories and packages.
- **Simple CLI:** An intuitive and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Getting started with Zoi is simple. Just follow these three steps:

1.  **Install Zoi:**
    Choose one of the [installation methods](#installation) below.

2.  **Sync Repositories:**
    Before you can install packages, you need to sync the package repositories.

    ```sh
    zoi sync
    ```

3.  **Install a Package:**
    Now you can install any package you want. For example, to install `hello`:

    ```sh
