description: How Zoi compares to other popular package managers like Pacman, APT, and Nix.
---

Zoi is a standalone, universal package manager with its own package format (`.pkg.lua`), build system, and local package repository. A key feature is its ability to integrate with and leverage existing system (like APT, Pacman) and language-specific (like Cargo, NPM) package managers for dependency resolution. This hybrid approach allows it to manage its own sandboxed packages while co-existing with the native tooling of an operating system.

This page compares Zoi to some other popular package managers.

| Feature                   | Zoi                                                                                                                                 | Pacman (Arch Linux)                                              | APT (Debian/Ubuntu)                                  | Nix                                                                                              |

| **Type**                  | Universal / Hybrid                                                                                                                  | OS-specific (Arch Linux)                                         | OS-specific (Debian-based)                           | Universal                                                                                        |
| **Package Definition**    | `.pkg.lua` (Lua script)                                                                                                             | `PKGBUILD` (Shell script)                                        | `debian/` directory                                  | `.nix` expression                                                                                |
| **Dependency Management** | Manages its own sandboxed packages. Can also install dependencies via other system/language managers.                               | System-wide, managed by Pacman.                                  | System-wide, managed by APT.                         | Purely functional. Dependencies are stored in `/nix/store` with unique hashes.                   |
| **Package Isolation**     | High. Packages are installed into versioned directories. Bins are symlinked.                                                        | Low. Files are installed into system-wide locations like `/usr`. | Low. Files are installed into system-wide locations. | Very High. Packages are isolated in the Nix store. Environments are built from these components. |
| **Reproducibility**       | Medium. Zoi packages are versioned, but dependencies from other managers can change.                                                | Medium. Depends on the state of Arch repositories.               | Medium. Depends on the state of APT repositories.    | Very High. Builds are bit-for-bit reproducible.                                                  |
| **Configuration**         | Declarative (`.pkg.lua`) and imperative scripting.                                                                                  | Declarative (`PKGBUILD`).                                        | Declarative (`debian/control`).                      | Purely functional and declarative (`.nix` files).                                                |
| **Cross-platform**        | Yes (Linux, macOS, Windows).                                                                                                        | No (Arch Linux only).                                            | No (Debian-based Linux only).                        | Yes (Linux, macOS).                                                                              |
| **Key Idea**              | Provide a self-contained, sandboxed package management system that is cross-platform and can integrate with other package managers. | Simplicity and user-centrism for a specific rolling-release OS.  | Robustness and stability for a stable-release OS.    | Purely functional package management for reproducible, declarative, and reliable systems.        |

## Summary

- **Choose Zoi if:** You work across multiple operating systems, use many different programming languages, and want a unified way to manage your tools and project dependencies without interfering with your system's state. Its Lua-based packaging offers great flexibility.

- **Choose Pacman/APT if:** You are happy with your OS's native package manager and primarily need to manage system-wide applications and libraries on a single machine.

- **Choose Nix if:** Your primary goal is maximum reproducibility and reliability. You want to build environments declaratively and are willing to learn the Nix language and its functional concepts.
