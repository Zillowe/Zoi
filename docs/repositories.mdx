This page explains Zoi's official repositories and mirrors, and how package repositories are organized by tier.

## Official package database

- Packages database (Zoidberg)
  - Primary: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Zillowe/Zillwen/Zusty/Zoidberg.git)
  - Mirrors: [GitHub](https://github.com/Zillowe/Zoidberg.git), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Zillowe/Zoidberg.git)

## Managing the Package Database Registry

The package database is the core git repository that Zoi clones to `~/.zoi/pkgs/db`. This repository contains all the package definitions organized into tiers. While you can manage which repositories inside the database are active using `zoi repo`, you can also change the URL of the entire database registry itself using `zoi sync`.

This is useful if you want to use a mirror or a completely different package database.

| Command                         | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zoi sync set <url-or-keyword>` | Sets the package database registry URL. Keywords: `default`, `gitlab`, `github`, `codeberg`. |
| `zoi sync list`                 | Displays the current configured registries.                                                  |
| `zoi sync add <url>`            | Adds a new registry to be synced.                                                            |
| `zoi sync remove <handle>`      | Removes a configured registry by its handle.                                                 |

### Examples

```sh
# Show the current configured registries
zoi sync list

# Set the registry to the official GitHub mirror
zoi sync set github

# Set the registry to a custom URL
zoi sync set https://my-custom-registry.com/Zoidberg.git
```

## Repository tiers

Zoi organizes packages into tiers. Use these to decide where a package belongs and to assess stability, example tiers (from [Zoidberg](/docs/zds/zoi/zoidberg).

| Repository  | Purpose                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`      | Essential packages and libraries; very common and well-maintained.                |
| `main`      | Important packages that don't fit in `core` but are essential for most users.     |
| `extra`     | New or niche packages; less common and may be less actively maintained.           |
| `community` | User-submitted packages. New entries start here and may graduate to higher tiers. |
| `test`      | Testing ground for new Zoi features and packages prior to release.                |
| `archive`   | Archived packages that are no longer maintained.                                  |
| `zillowe`   | Zillowe: Zillowe's own official packages.                                         |

Note: Packages from `community`, `test`, and `archive` may carry higher risk. Zoi prints warnings where appropriate.

## Managing Active Repositories

The `zoi repo` command manages which repositories from the package database are active. Active repositories are searched during package operations like `install` and `search`.

| Command                       | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zoi repo add`                | Add an official repo by name or a git repo by URL (interactive if no args).                       |
| `zoi repo rm <name>`          | Remove a repository from the active list.                                                         |
| `zoi repo list` (alias: `ls`) | Show active repositories from config. Use `zoi repo list all` to show all available repositories. |
| `zoi repo git ls`             | List cloned git repositories under `~/.zoi/pkgs/git`.                                             |
| `zoi repo git rm <repo>`      | Remove a cloned git repository directory.                                                         |

### Examples

```sh
# Add a repository interactively
zoi repo add

# Add official repositories by name
zoi repo add core
zoi repo add main
zoi repo add community

# Add by git URL (cloned under ~/.zoi/pkgs/git/ and used via @git/<repo>/<pkg>)
zoi repo add https://github.com/YourOrg/my-zoi-repo.git

# Remove and list
zoi repo rm community
zoi repo list
zoi repo list all
zoi repo git ls
zoi repo git rm my-zoi-repo
```

### Direct Git Repository Installation

In addition to adding a git repository to your local configuration with `zoi repo add`, you can install a package directly from a remote git repository using the `--repo` flag with `zoi install`.

```sh
# Install from a GitHub repository
zoi install --repo Zillowe/Hello

# Install from a GitLab repository
zoi install --repo gl:Zillowe/Hello

# Install from a Codeberg repository
zoi install --repo cb:Zillowe/Hello
```

This works if the target repository has a `zoi.yaml` file in its root. The `package` field in this file can specify a package name (e.g. `hello`), a path to a `.pkg.lua` file within the repository, or a URL to a `.pkg.lua` file. This provides a quick way to install packages from git repositories without permanently adding them to your configuration.

**Provider Prefixes:**

- `gh:` or `github:` for GitHub (this is the default if no prefix is given).
- `gl:` or `gitlab:` for GitLab.
- `cb:` or `codeberg:` for Codeberg.

## Installing from a specific repository

You can specify which repository or registry to install a package from using special prefixes.

- **From a top-level repository in the default registry:**

  This installs `htop` from the `community` repository.

  ```sh
  zoi install @community/htop
  ```

- **From a specific sub-package:**

  This installs the `headers` sub-package from the `linux` package in the `core` repository.

  ```sh
  zoi install @core/linux:headers
  ```

- **From a nested repository path:**

  This is useful for platform-specific packages.

  ```sh
  zoi install @core/linux/amd64/nvidia-driver
  ```

- **From a specific registry:**

  If you have multiple registries configured (see `zoi sync list`), you can target one using its handle. This installs `my-package` from the `my-repo` repository within the `my-registry` registry.

  ```sh
  zoi install #my-registry@my-repo/my-package
  ```

- **From a custom git repository:**

  Use the `@git/` prefix, followed by the repository name (the directory name in `~/.zoi/pkgs/git/`) and the package name.

  ```sh
  # Install from a nested directory within the git repo
  zoi install @git/my-zoi-repo/path/to/package
  ```

- **From a remote git repository on the fly:**

  You can install a package directly from a remote git repository that acts as a Zoi registry, without adding it first. This is useful for testing or one-off installations. The repository must contain a `repo.yaml` file.

  The syntax is `#git:<host>/<user>/<repo>@<repo_in_registry>/<package>`.

  Supported hosts are `github.com`, `gitlab.com`, and `codeberg.org`.

  ```sh
  # Install 'my-package' from the 'community' repo inside a registry hosted on GitHub
  zoi install '#git:github.com/some-user/my-zoi-registry@community/my-package'
  ```

For creating packages, see [Creating Packages](/docs/zds/zoi/creating-packages).

For publishing packages, see [Publishing Packages](/docs/zds/zoi/publishing-packages).

## The `repo.yaml` file

A Zoi package registry is defined by a `repo.yaml` file at its root. This file contains metadata about the repository, such as its name, description, and the URLs for its git repository and pre-built packages. When you run `zoi sync`, Zoi also automatically imports any PGP keys listed in the `pgp` section.

Here are the fields available in `repo.yaml`:

| Field         | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | `string`            | The name of the repository. This is used as the handle for the registry.                                                                                            |
| `description` | `string`            | A short description of the repository.                                                                                                                              |
| `git`         | `list` of `GitLink` | A list of git repository URLs. The `type` can be `main` for the primary repository or `mirror` for fallbacks.                                                       |
| `pkg`         | `list` of `PkgLink` | (Optional) A list of URLs for pre-built package registries. Zoi will try to download pre-built packages from here before building from source.                      |
| `pgp`         | `list` of `PgpKey`  | (Optional) A list of PGP keys to import for package signature verification. The `key` can be a URL to the key file or a PGP fingerprint.                            |
| `repos`       | `list` of `Repo`    | A list of the sub-repositories (or tiers) contained within the registry. `type` can be `offical`, `community`, etc. `active` determines if it's enabled by default. |

### `PkgLink` Placeholders

The `url`, `pgp`, and `hash` fields within a `PkgLink` object can contain the following placeholders, which Zoi will replace at runtime:

- `{os}`: The operating system (e.g. `linux`, `macos`, `windows`).
- `{arch}`: The CPU architecture (e.g. `amd64`, `arm64`).
- `{version}`: The version of the package.
- `{repo}`: The name of the sub-repository (e.g. `core`, `main`).
